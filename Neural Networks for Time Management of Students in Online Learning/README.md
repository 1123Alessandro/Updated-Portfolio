# Neural Networks for Time Management of Students in Online Learning

A collaborative research done during the 12th grade of Senior High School in Aquinas School. 
Focused on the effects of the students' workload quantity, time-constraints, requirement difficulty, and subjective effort in creating a good quality output.

## My Major Contributions

Although much of the paper writing was done equally by both members, I spearheaded the development of the python script to analyze the data.
It is admissible to say that this script is flawed in its major aspects but a good start in my data science journey.

Recommendations for project remaster:
1. Use a csv parser (e.g. pandas, numpy, etc.)
1. Use a third party API for developing the neural network
1. Include activation functions if designing a neural network from scratch (i.e. without third party APIs)
