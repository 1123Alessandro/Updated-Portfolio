# WiKatulong

A *Buwan ng Wika* Project focused on creating an aid for the study, understanding, and proliferation of the Filipino language.

## Major Contributions

I focused on typing all of the information for the origins and syntax of the Filipino language. I also dabbled in creating the CSS design for all of the pages except the home page.

Recommendations for project remaster:
1. Integrate an SQL database for all of the data
